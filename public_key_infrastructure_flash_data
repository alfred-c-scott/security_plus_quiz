SAN (Subject Alternative Name)
--Allows a certificate owner to specify additional domains and IP addresses to be supported
Dual-Sided Certificates
--Requires both the server and the user to be validated but requires more processing power and is typically only used in high security settings
X.690
--Uses BER, CER, and DER for encoding certificates
CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
--An online list of a digital certificates authority

Key Recovery Agent
--A specialized type of software that allows the restoration of a lost or corrupted key to be performed\
Web of Trust
--A decentralized trust model that addresses issues associated with the public authentication of public keys within a CA-based PKI system
Transitive Trust
--Occurs when X trusts Y, and Y trusts Z, therefore X trusts Z
